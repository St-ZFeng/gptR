Title: Plug GPT Directly into Your R Data Analysis Process
Version: 0.1.0
Author: person(given= "Feng", family = "Zhao", email = "515264833@qq.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Enables you to plug models such as GPT directly into the R language data analysis process.
    In short, the AIPROCESS function is utilized to achieve this functionality. All you need to do is write down your requirements, choose a model and pass 
    the necessary data variables into the function. The model then gives you everything, including variables, dataframes and even a plot! The best part is 
    that it all runs automatically and is customized to your data structure, so it is relatively efficient and fast. This somewhat avoids the dilemma of 
    laboriously communicating with your model and then copying the resulting code into R to run it.
    Rest assured that the content of your data is not passed on to the model, thus ensuring a degree of data privacy. The model only gets the name and 
    class of the variable, and for data types such as dataframes, the name of its column and the class of the column.
    See the the AIPROCESS function description documentation for a more detailed description.
